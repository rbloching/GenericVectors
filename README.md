Generic Vectors
===================

GenericVectors provides functions for vectorized operations on native C# generic arrays, targeting .NET Standard. It is intended
to provide performance closer to typed-arrays for vector math compared to using routines built on just generic operators (such as provided by 
JTForks.MiscUtil or Generic.Math).
