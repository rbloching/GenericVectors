Generic Vectors
===================

GenericVectors provides functions for vectorized operations on native C# generic arrays, targeting .NET Standard.

It is intended
to provide performance closer to typed-arrays for vector math compared to using routines built on just generic operators (such as provided by
[JTForks.MiscUtil](https://github.com/jaredthirsk/JTForks.MiscUtil) or [Generic.Math](https://github.com/HelloKitty/Generic.Math)).
